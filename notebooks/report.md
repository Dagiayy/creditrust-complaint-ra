### ðŸ“Š Summary of EDA and Preprocessing

The CFPB complaint dataset contains nearly 9.6 million records, but only about 2.98 million of them include consumer complaint narratives. To align with the challengeâ€™s business goals, we applied a strict filter that focuses on five key financial products: Credit card, Personal loan, BNPL, Savings account, and Money transfers. After removing records without narratives, we retained **82,164 cleaned complaints**â€”a focused dataset designed to maximize business relevance and retrievability.

However, the EDA also revealed that several high-volume product categories were excludedâ€”such as Credit reporting and Debt collectionâ€”with millions of complaints containing rich narrative content. To account for broader use cases and future tuning, we processed an **expanded dataset** as well, including more product types, which resulted in **1.27 million cleaned complaint narratives**.

No word count threshold was enforced at this stage, ensuring that short but potentially useful entries remain available for downstream filtering or model evaluation. This dual-path strategy (strict and expanded filtering) offers flexibility for experimentation and supports a robust RAG development pipeline.
